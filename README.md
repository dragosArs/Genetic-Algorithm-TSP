## Project: Genetic Algorithm that approximates a solution for the Traveling Salesman Problem

This algorithm represents an attempt at finding a good-enough solution for the NP-hard problem TSP. it uses Machine Learning to calculate an approximation of the optimal solution in polynomial time.

## How to use it
There is number of hyperparameters that can be edited in order to change the behaviour of the algorithm. The ones that I have chosen are standard for thi type of problem, but they may be changed in order to improve running-time in the case of large inputs.
After appropriate changes have been made to these parameters, add your desired input in the data folder, run Main.py and enter the filename("./data/*filename*) of the input when prompted.
It should take a few seconds to a few minutes to get a route and its corresponding length.
